# autopilotforUAV_GPS
Completely finished application - GPS tracker. Uses 2 providers - GPS and GSM base stations to determine the coordinates, calculate the bearing to the specified coordinates, altitude and speed.
If we add a class for sending SMS (available here in another repository) and a timer, we will get a ready-made tracker for tracking the movement of the device.
A very important thing for the autopilot is the continuous operation of the application. It is necessary to work reliably with the implementation of background tasks.
